The SVM (Support Vector Machine) implementation provided in this project offers a custom-built, versatile machine learning classifier capable of handling both binary and multi-class classification tasks. This implementation supports various kernel functions, including linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF), which allows it to adapt to different types of data distributions effectively.


## SVM Implementation Project

This repository contains the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) from scratch along with its application on various datasets. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the functionality of SVMs using different kernels and how they can be applied to solve classification problems.

### Key Features:

- **Kernel Flexibility**: Users can select between different kernel functions according to the nature of the dataset and the specific requirements of the classification task. This flexibility enhances the model's ability to capture complex patterns in data.
- **Customizable Hyperparameters**: The implementation provides options to adjust key hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter \(C\) and kernel-specific parameters (like degree in polynomial and gamma in RBF), enabling fine-tuning of the model's balance between bias and variance.
- **Multiclass Support**: For datasets with more than two classes, the SVM is extended via a one-vs-one approach, involving the construction of multiple binary classifiers whose results are combined to make the final class decision.
- **Optimization Technique**: The model utilizes the quadratic programming solver from the cvxopt library to optimize the dual problem of the SVM, ensuring efficient learning especially when dealing with large feature spaces.

### Implementation Details:

- **Initialization**: The SVM class is initialized with a choice of kernel and regularization parameter. This design allows for the instantiation of the model tailored to specific data characteristics.
- **Kernel Functions**: Custom lambda functions define the linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels, providing the mathematical operations needed to compute the Gram matrix between feature vectors.
- **Training Process**: During training, the SVM model computes the Lagrange multipliers using quadratic programming, which determines the optimal decision boundary and support vectors based on the chosen kernel and data.
- **Prediction**: For prediction, the implementation uses the support vectors and their corresponding coefficients to compute the decision function, which is then used to classify new instances.

This SVM implementation is designed not only to serve as an educational tool to understand the mechanics of SVMs but also as a robust classifier that can be integrated into various data analysis pipelines requiring precise and nuanced classification capabilities.
